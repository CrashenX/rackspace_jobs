### About the Team:

We enjoy belonging to a tight-knit team with a passion for monitoring and production systems. Monitoring is a broad and challenging domain, so it keeps us humble and we are always learning. Our ideal is that every member of the team is a peer who contributes code and expertise to all components of our application. Our team’s work is highly visible, so come prepared to make a big contribution. 

We ship code every day, using tools such as comprehensive unit and integration tests to stay confident in the correctness of our changes and our product’s resilience and availability. All our projects use a collaborative development model. Reviewing code is as important to us as writing it, and the design, direction, and testing of our product is everyone’s responsibility. 

We build things for people who build things; we want teammates who want to build the monitoring tools they’ve always wanted.
